--------

This repository contains my Web Application Development Project 2019 submission. 

The files combine to form a HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIT website, startingwith the "langing_Page.html".

It is recommended to run this document using a Google Chrome browser. no specific installations are required, however a python server is used to extract a .csv file and read it onto Javascript for the "externalData.html" page. Navigate to the folder the file is in and enter "python -m http.server" on the command line. Then access the page using the following link from your browser http://localhost:8000/externalData.html.

All references and sources used to support the code creation are documented within the .html files. No other datasets are required.

All supplimentary images are stored within the repository.
