--------

This repository contains my Web Application Development Project 2019 submission. 

The files combine to form a HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIT website, startingwith the "langing_Page.html".

It is recommended to run this document using a Google Chrome browser. no specific installations are required, however a python server is used to extract a .csv file and read it onto Javascript.

All references and sources used to support the code creation are documented within the .html files. No other datasets are required.

All supplimentary images are stored within the repository.
